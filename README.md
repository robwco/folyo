# Folyo

Built with Jekyll, [Folyo](http://folyo.me) is a directory of hand-picked freelance projects I find every day. I mostly focus mostly on design and development projects, so if you'd like to get featured let me know.  

I use [Drip](http://getdrip.com) to send out the weekly newsletter and [Zapier](http://zapier) to connect my RSS feed to my [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/yofolyo)

Unfortunately since this is a side project I can't provide support on the project. However, if there's a bug or I've featured your project and you wish to be removed, [create a new issue here](https://github.com/robwco/folyo/issues) and I will take care of it shortly.

Thanks!
